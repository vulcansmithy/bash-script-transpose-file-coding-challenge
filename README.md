Once done, provide us the link to your publicly accessible git repo. Please also add the instruction on how to run the Bash script you written.



## Instruction

Given a text file **file.txt**, transpose its content. You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the ‘ ‘ character.

For example, if **file.txt** has the following content:

```
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
```

Output the following:

```
name alice ryan
age 21 30
```
